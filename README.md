Sortware engineering project:

As part of the CMPT*328 class we made a Unity game, Math Knights. As a part of a team of three I learned to understand the concepts and 
techniques of software design. Math Knights was an education based math came designed for first grades. A player could make a profile 
and explore the map to choose a level to play. To get more lives agains the math monster the player had to answer correclty to basic
math questions. After playing the player could see their progress and try to get more right answers and beat the math monster faster. 
This project taught me a lot and made me want to learn more. During this time our team faced multiple issues which made me improve 
my problem solving skills. Through this project I understood the power of communication, as the better we communicated
the better results we accomplished as a team.
