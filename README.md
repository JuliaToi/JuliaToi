Math Knights:

As part of the CMPT*322 class we made a Unity game called Math Knights. As a part of a team of three I learned to understand the concepts and 
techniques of software design. This project offered a lot of freedom which challenged my creativy but at the same time it made me critically
think my own skills and what is possible to accomplish within the timeline. 
Math Knights was an education based math came designed for first grades. A player could make a profile and explore the map to choose a level to play. To get more lives agains the math monster the player had to answer correclty to basic math questions. After playing the player could see their progress and try to get more right answers and beat the math monster faster. 
This project taught me a lot and made me want to learn more. During this time our team faced multiple issues which made me improve my problem solving skills. Through this project I understood the power of communication, as the better we communicated the better results we accomplished as a team.


Password-lock:

As a part of CMPT Embodded computer systems I learned to attain a system-level understanding of the computer. In this class I build an embodded computer project using arduino and hardware. My project was a password-lock system where a user could open the lock by using a 4x4 Matrix keyboard. If the user entered the correct passcode the lock would open and the lock was programmed to lock it self for longer period of time after 3 incorrect guesses. The project consisted of 4 major hardware parts, Keypad, Servo motor, LED lights and the LCD screen. This assignment made me really understand how to combine hardware with software and offered me a lot of creativity as we were encouranged to build whatever we wanted. Of course this made me critically to think what could be possible and what would be too much of reach. All in all I liked the project as I could really see the work of what I did and it offered a fun challenge of how to combine different parst of computer science.
